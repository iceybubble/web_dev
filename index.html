 <p>BTS in 2013 performing at the Incheon Music Center
 BTS was formed in 2010, after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk wanted to form a hip hop group around RM (Kim Nam-joon), an underground rapper well known on the music scene in Seoul. At the time, physical album sales were on the decline and digital revenues were not yet high enough to compensate.[9] Seeing a need for diversified income streams, Bang decided to form an idol group instead, because of the potential for live concert performances and passionate support from fans of such groups. Many trainees refused to become part of an idol group, but J-Hope, RM, and Suga remained.[9] Bang chose to vary from the usual,
 highly regimented idol groups and create one where the members would be individuals rather than an ensemble and free to
 express themselves.</p>
